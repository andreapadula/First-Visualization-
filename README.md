# First-Visualization

this project was done by using openFrameworks 


By using random number given as text file, each number is drawn as a semi-transparent circle in a position specified by it’s value. Duplicates are draw on top of each other, creating more opacity for more frequent numbers.

The result should look like this:

![Alt text](part1A.png?raw=true "Title")

Make a simple histogram of the occurrence of each number. To do so, we’ll first count how frequent each is, store the counts in an array, and then create a histogram by drawing a bar for each number

The result should look like this:

![Alt text](Part1B.png?raw=true "Title")

we can also play a little bit with the colors to obtain this effect 


![Alt text](Part1BA.png?raw=true "Title")


We can now do this to draw a nice big grid where each cell rapresent a number and more occurence of that number the color will be more towards red.

![Alt text](Part1C.png?raw=true "Title")
